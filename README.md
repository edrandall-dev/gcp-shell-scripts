# gcp-shell-scripts

These are a collection of bash scripts which I've put together (mostly using Google's own documentation) to build out a wordpress environment consisting of Compute Engine, Cloud SQL, Cloud Storage, Load Balancers, SSL, etc.

It's in no way intended to be anything other than a vehicle for me to learn the various commands and syntax using the gcloud CLI.
